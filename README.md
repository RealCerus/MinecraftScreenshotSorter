# Minecraft Screenshot Sorter
This is a little fun project that I worked on in about 4-5 hours. It looks through your minecraft screenshots and sorts them in a nice directory structure.

# How to use
1. Choose your minecraft screenshots folder
2. Choose the preferred output directory where the screenshots will be sorted
3. Click "Sort"
4. Wait
5. Done!
